## *A brief game description*

**2 The Pods** is an couch co-op platformer which is taking place in a space station about to blow up, you and your friend are stuck and need to make your way to the evacuation pods as soon as possible. One player controls a little astronaut, the other player moves modules around to create a path for the first player. The astronaut has an oxygen gauge that runs down, inciting the players to hurry. There are also a number of deadly traps strewn across the modules for the astronaut to avoid.
